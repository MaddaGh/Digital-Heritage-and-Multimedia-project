### Abstract:

This design brief concerns the proposed development of an Augmented Reality (AR) application for the 
Museo di Antropologia, of Sistema Museale di Ateneo (SMA) of the Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di 
Bologna. This on-site application, to be applied on the museum’s rich collection of human remains, is 
primarily concerned with the valorization of these items – in all of their anthropological significance and 
cultural diversity – where the added digital layer encourages better reflexivity on the arbitrary boundary 
we habitually draw between the “anatomical” and the “cultural”, promoting as such these items as truthful 
and meaningful cultural heritage objects. Supporting the anthological field’s recent evolutions in 
promoting perspective-taking and care for cultures pertaining to different times and places, our digital 
tool project aims to un-layer the human dimensions from their conceived isolations from each other, as 
well as virtually animate human remains, in such a way to provoke better engagement of the public with 
these singular objects that we believe, if well supported by the virtual, can better fulfill their mind
changing and empathic potentials.
